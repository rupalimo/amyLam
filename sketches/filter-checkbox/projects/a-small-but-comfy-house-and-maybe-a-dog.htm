							Age 25: I’ll be married by now. I’ll have a job — a speech arts

					<!-- project description here -->
					<p>
						The title of this exhibition comes from a text, “Me in the Future,”
						that I wrote at age eleven and put in a time capsule, speculating by
						the age of twenty-five I’d be married, have a career, and “a small
						but comfy house and maybe a dog.” Starting from these childhood
						fantasies of domestic love and financial stability, this exhibition
						explores how these dreams function within the wider contexts of
						colonial history, property, theft, and institutional collections.
					</p>
					<p>
						Furniture from my childhood home, which my parents were in the midst
						of moving out of that year, served as all of the supports (plinths,
						etc.) in the exhibition. This project was also shaped by its
						neighbours: a luxury condominium development happening across the
						street, and the Richmond Public Library next door. The Richmond
						Public Library holds a large collection of Chinese-language
						materials amassed by a feng shui scholar. Some of these materials
						were brought into my exhibition, and I consulted a feng shui
						practitioner for advice for my exhibition installation. Feng shui is
						the Daoist practice of ensuring harmony between individual and
						environment.
					</p>
					<p>
						Looty played the role of the imagined dog from the exhibition title.
