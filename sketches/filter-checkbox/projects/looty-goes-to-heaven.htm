							Back at the gate to heaven, Looty watched a hedgehog waddle its
							way through the hole in the thicket. Before she could go in, she
							had to give the green-faced person a true account of her life. The
							green-faced person said, in their gravelly voice, “It can be as
							short or as long as you like. The only condition is that it must
							be absolutely true.”

					<p>
						A small Pekingese dog was taken from China at the end of the Second
						Opium War by British troops, brought to England, and gifted to Queen
						Victoria. This dog was renamed Looty, after the activity of
						“looting,” in reference to how the dog was found during the looting
						of the Summer Palace (Yuanmingyuan) outside of Beijing. Looty lived
						for twelve years at the British royal palaces and died in 1872. It
						is not known where she was buried.
					</p>
					<p>
						This project revives Looty’s story in the context of Birmingham, UK,
						which is the current site of Crufts, the largest dog show in the
						world, as well as the home of Ty-phoo tea, a brand named after the
						Chinese word for doctor. The colonial trades of tea and opium were
						closely linked: in the 1800s, the British demand for tea became so
						costly that British merchants invented a new, exploitative form of
						opium farming to pay for it. Grown by indentured labourers on
						plantations in South Asia, opium was imported on a massive scale
						into China until the Chinese objected, leading to the Opium Wars.
						Meanwhile, Looty was the first Pekingese dog in England, and her
						arrival informed new trends in chinoiserie, dog breeding, and
						eugenics. For close to fifty years, Pekingese dogs were the most
						popular breed of toy dog in England.
					</p>

					<p>
						Looty Goes to Heaven takes the form of an animation, a speculative
						fiction, and a poppy meadow. The looping animation, made in
						collaboration with artist Emerson Maxwell, shows Looty in a state of
						eternal rest. The speculative fiction book, available in English and
						Traditional Chinese, imagines Looty’s life and afterlife.
					</p>
					<p>
						Looty’s Meadow (2024-ongoing), planted in Digbeth, Birmingham, a few
						blocks away from the site of the Ty-phoo tea factory, features
						varieties of papaver somniferum (opium poppy) and papaver orientale
						alongside a wildflower meadow.
