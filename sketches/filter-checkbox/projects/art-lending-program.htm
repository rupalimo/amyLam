						<h1>Art Lending Program</h1>
						<!-- project description here -->
						<p>
							Original artworks from the Richmond Art Galleryâ€™s permanent
							collection were made available for loan to the public through the
							Richmond Public Library next door, for the duration of my
							exhibition <a href="a-small-but-comfy-house-and-maybe-a-dog.htm" title="a small but comfy house and maybe a dog, project page">a small but comfy house and maybe a dog.</a>
						</p>
						<p>
							The artworks in the <em>Art Lending Program</em> were by artists Diyan
							Achjadi, Amir Ali Alibhai, Len Gardiner, Judith Gillis, Roy Green,
							Evan Lee, Laurens Lee, Zshu-Zshu Mark, and Alan Wood. A drawing of
							Looty by Emerson Maxwell was also made available for loan.
						</p>
						<p>
							This project was inspired by 1) a rejected attempt by the Richmond
							Art Gallery to borrow a painting of
							<a
								title="Royal Collection Trust: Looty, Friedrich Wilhelm Keyl (1823-71)"
								href="https://www.rct.uk/collection/406974/looty"
								target="_blank"
								>Looty</a
							>
							from the Royal Collection for my exhibition, and 2) by the
							childhood experience of curator Su-Ying Lee, described in the PDF linked to the left.
