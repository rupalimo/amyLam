					<h1>Art Lending Program</h1>
					<!-- project description here -->
					<p>Original artworks from the Richmond Art Galleryâ€™s permanent collection were made available for loan to the public through the Richmond Public Library next door, for the duration of my exhibition a small but comfy house and maybe a dog.</p>
					<p>The artworks in the Art Lending Program were by artists Diyan Achjadi, Amir Ali Alibhai, Len Gardiner, Judith Gillis, Roy Green, Evan Lee, Laurens Lee, Zshu-Zshu Mark, and Alan Wood. A drawing of Looty by Emerson Maxwell was also made available for loan.</p>
					<p>This project was inspired by 1) a rejected attempt by the Richmond Art Gallery to borrow a painting of Looty from the Royal Collection for my exhibition, and 2) by the childhood experience of curator Su-Ying Lee, described below.</p>
