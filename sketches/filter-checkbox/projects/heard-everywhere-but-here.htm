								…Your father speaking through you—despite, or because of, his
								own silence—perfectly illustrates the functioning of ideology.
								The pain and tenderness requisite in attempting to transform
								that speech is expressed in Jordan’s description of a close-up
								photograph that their mother took of a hug between them and
								their father, after they won the contest: “My mom takes the
								photo almost as if she’s inside the hug, but also outside it.”

						An essay commissioned for Jordan Lord’s extraordinary 2023-4
						exhibition The Voice of Democracy, which, amongst other things,
						detailed their participation in a patriotic high school essay
						contest titled “The Voice of Democracy.”
