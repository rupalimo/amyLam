							Talked to Slippers about his friend who lives next door to me,
							where the windows have been installed upside down, with the
							openings at the top, not the bottom, so none of the tenants can
							install A/Cs. It gets extremely hot in the summer and it’s
							expensive. ‘Like hell,’ Slippers said.

						From December 2021 to December 2022, I kept a record of each time
						real estate, property or housing came up in conversation. The idea
						was to write down all of the instances where real estate, property,
						and housing came up in conversation.
					</p>
					<p>
						Part of my compulsion to start this journal came from how I identify
						with being a ‘productive’ person. I’ve always wanted to have a daily
						writing practice but never managed to keep one. Many of the verbs
						that are used to describe actions in relation to time—waste, carve,
						kill—can also be used with property.
					</p>
					<p>
						I’ve heard that you shouldn’t bring up real estate in conversation
						because then you’ll get stuck talking about it. The conversation
						will get stuck.
