								Original artworks from the Richmond Art Gallery’s permanent

								The artworks in the <em>Art Lending Program</em> were by artists
								Diyan Achjadi, Amir Ali Alibhai, Len Gardiner, Judith Gillis,
								Roy Green, Evan Lee, Laurens Lee, Zshu-Zshu Mark, and Alan Wood.
								A drawing of Looty by Emerson Maxwell was also made available
								for loan.
							</p>
							<p>
								This project was inspired by 1) a rejected attempt by the
								Richmond Art Gallery to borrow a painting of
								<a

									href="https://www.rct.uk/collection/406974/looty"

								>
								from the Royal Collection for my exhibition, and 2) by the
								childhood experience of curator Su-Ying Lee, described in the
								PDF linked to the left.
