					<h1>Heard everywhere but here essay</h1>
					<p>
						…Your father speaking through you—despite, or because of, his own
						silence—perfectly illustrates the functioning of ideology. The pain
						and tenderness requisite in attempting to transform that speech is
						expressed in Jordan’s description of a close-up photograph that
						their mother took of a hug between them and their father, after they
						won the contest: “My mom takes the photo almost as if she’s inside
						the hug, but also outside it.”
					</p>
					<p>
						An essay commissioned for Jordan Lord’s extraordinary 2023-4
						exhibition The Voice of Democracy, which, amongst other things,
						detailed their participation in a patriotic high school essay
						contest titled “The Voice of Democracy.”
