								My first collection of poetry, <em>Baby Book,</em> stacks story
								upon story to explore how beliefs are first formed. From a
								family vacation on a discount bus tour to a cosmogony based on
								cheese, these poems accumulate around principles of contingency
								and revelation.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Baby Book</em> describes the vivid tactility of growth and
								death—how everything is constantly, painfully remade—offering a
								vision against the stuck narratives of property and inheritance.
								Power is located in the senses, in wind: multiple and restless.

							“What happens when a sense memory steals us away? Like a hole cut
							into a museum wall that pulls smells from the cafe downstairs into
							the gallery, Amy Ching-Yan Lam’s poems are a seduction of
							non-destination. What becomes of a sense memory who is also an
							ancestor? An ancestor never met, an ancestor-to-become, an
							ancestor to spend more time with. Baby Book’s collective surrogacy
							undoes lineage for all our sakes. For the sake of death, for the
							sake of life, for heaven’s sake, praise this beautiful Baby Book.”

							“These poems draw the reader in with the intimacy of the personal
							and the individual, only to break your heart with the collective
							world-making violences of colonial extraction, displacement, and
							capitalism’s accumulations. These are poems and a poetics of
							ethics.”

							“Baby Book is a gorgeous book of poems that refract global histories through the prisms of social, familial, and daily life. Lam’s poems are full of pleasure and surprise.”
