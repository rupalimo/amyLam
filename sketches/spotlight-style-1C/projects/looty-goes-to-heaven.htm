									Back at the gate to heaven, Looty watched a hedgehog waddle
									its way through the hole in the thicket. Before she could go
									in, she had to give the green-faced person a true account of
									her life. The green-faced person said, in their gravelly
									voice, “It can be as short or as long as you like. The only
									condition is that it must be absolutely true.”

						<div class="project__text">
							<p>
								A small Pekingese dog was taken from China at the end of the
								Second Opium War by British troops, brought to England, and
								gifted to Queen Victoria. This dog was renamed Looty, after the
								activity of “looting,” in reference to how the dog was obtained
								from the Summer Palace (Yuanmingyuan) outside of Beijing. Looty
								lived for twelve years at the British royal palaces and died in
								1872. It is not known where she was buried.
							</p>
							<p>
								This project revives Looty’s story in the context of Birmingham,
								UK, which is the current site of Crufts, the largest dog show in
								the world, as well as the home of Ty-phoo tea, a brand named
								after the Chinese word for doctor. The colonial trades of tea
								and opium were closely linked: in the 1800s, the British demand
								for tea became so costly that British merchants invented a new,
								exploitative form of opium farming to pay for it. Grown by
								indentured labourers on plantations in South Asia, opium was
								imported on a massive scale into China until the Chinese
								objected, leading to the Opium Wars. Meanwhile, Looty was the
								first Pekingese dog in England, and her arrival informed new
								trends in chinoiserie, dog breeding, and eugenics. For close to
								fifty years, Pekingese dogs were the most popular breed of toy
								dog in England.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Looty Goes to Heaven</em> takes the form of an
								<span class="inline-bold">animation,</span> a
								<span class="inline-bold">speculative fiction,</span> and a
								<span class="inline-bold">poppy meadow.</span> The looping
								animation, made in collaboration with artist Emerson Maxwell,
								shows Looty in a state of eternal rest. The speculative fiction
								book, available in English and Traditional Chinese, imagines
								Looty’s life and afterlife.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Looty’s Meadow</em> (2024-ongoing), planted in Digbeth,
								Birmingham, a few blocks away from the site of the Ty-phoo tea
								factory, features varieties of papaver somniferum (opium poppy)
								and papaver orientale alongside a wildflower meadow.
